This package provides =marginalia-mode= which adds marginalia to the minibuffer
completions. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia][Marginalia]] are marks or annotations placed at the margin of the
page of a book or in this case helpful colorful annotations placed at the margin
of the minibuffer for your completion candidates. Marginalia can only add
annotations to the completion candidates. It cannot modify the appearance of the
candidates themselves, which are shown unaltered as supplied by the original
command.

The annotations are added based on the completion category. For example
=find-file= reports the =file= category and =M-x= reports the =command= category. You
can cycle between more or less detailed annotators or even disable the annotator
with command =marginalia-cycle=.

* Configuration

It is recommended to use Marginalia together with either the [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]], [[https://github.com/protesilaos/mct][Mct]],
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Icomplete.html][Icomplete]] or the default completion UI. Furthermore Marginalia can be combined
with [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] for action support and [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]], which provides many useful commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Enable rich annotations using the Marginalia package
(use-package marginalia
  ;; Bind `marginalia-cycle' locally in the minibuffer.  To make the binding
  ;; available in the *Completions* buffer, add it to the
  ;; `completion-list-mode-map'.
  :bind (:map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-A" . marginalia-cycle))

  ;; The :init section is always executed.
  :init

  ;; Marginalia must be activated in the :init section of use-package such that
  ;; the mode gets enabled right away. Note that this forces loading the
  ;; package.
  (marginalia-mode))
#+end_src

* Information shown by the annotators

In general, to learn more about what different annotations mean, a good starting
point is to look at ~marginalia-annotators~, and follow up to the annotation
function of the category you are interested in.

For example the annotations for Elisp symbols include their symbol class - =v= for
variable, =f= for function, =c= for command, etc. For more information on what the
different classifications mean, see the docstring of ~marginalia--symbol-class~.

* Adding custom annotators or classifiers

*IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR PACKAGE AUTHORS*: The intention of the Marginalia package is
to give the user means to overwrite completion categories and to add custom
annotators for existing commands in their user configuration. *Marginalia is a
user facing package and is not intended to be used as a library*. Therefore
Marginalia does not expose library functions as part of its public API. If you
add your own completion commands to your package we recommend to specify an
=annotation-function= or an =affixation-function=, avoiding the Marginalia
dependency this way. The =annotation-function= and =affixation-function= are
documented in the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html][Elisp manual]]. If you use =consult--read=, you can specify an
=:annotate= keyword argument.

There is an exception to our recommendation: If you want to implement
annotations for an existing package =hypothetic.el=, which does not have
annotations and where annotations cannot be added, then the creation of a
=marginalia-hypothetic.el= package is a good idea, since Marginalia provides the
facilities to enhance existing commands from the outside.

Commands that support minibuffer completion use a completion table of all the
available candidates. Candidates are associated with a *category* such as =command=,
=file=, =face=, or =variable= depending on what the candidates are. Based on the
category of the candidates, Marginalia selects an *annotator* to generate
annotations for display for each candidate.

Unfortunately, not all commands (including Emacs' builtin ones) specify the
category of their candidates. To compensate for this shortcoming, Marginalia
hooks into the Emacs completion framework and runs the *classifiers* listed in the
variable =marginalia-classifiers=, which use the command's prompt or other
properties of the candidates to specify the completion category.

For example, the =marginalia-classify-by-prompt= classifier checks the minibuffer
prompt against regexps listed in the =marginalia-prompt-categories= alist to
determine a category. The following is already included but would be a way to
assign the category =face= to all candidates from commands with prompts that
include the word "face".

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'marginalia-prompt-categories '("\\<face\\>" . face))
#+end_src

The =marginalia-classify-by-command-name= classifier uses the alist
=marginalia-command-categories= to specify the completion category based on the
command name. This is particularly useful if the prompt classifier yields a
false positive.

Completion categories are also important for [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]], which associates actions
based on the completion category and benefits from Marginalia's classifiers.

Once the category of the candidates is known, Marginalia looks in the
=marginalia-annotators= to find the associated annotator to use. An annotator is a
function that takes a completion candidate string as an argument and returns an
annotation string to be displayed after the candidate in the minibuffer. More
than one annotator can be assigned to each each category, displaying more, less
or different information. Use the =marginalia-cycle= command to cycle between the
annotations of different annotators defined for the current category.

Here's an example of a basic face annotator:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-face-annotator (cand)
    (when-let* ((sym (intern-soft cand)))
      (concat (propertize " " 'display '(space :align-to center))
              (propertize "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" 'face sym))))
#+end_src

After defining a new annotator, associate it with a category in the annotator
registry as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'marginalia-annotators
               '(face my-face-annotator marginalia-annotate-face builtin none))
#+end_src

This makes the =my-face-annotator= the first of four annotators for the face
category. The others are the annotator provided by Marginalia
(=marginalia-annotate-face=), the =builtin= annotator as defined by Emacs and the
=none= annotator, which disables the annotations. With this setting, after
invoking =M-x describe-face RET= you can cycle between all of these annotators
using =marginalia-cycle=.

* Disabling annotators, builtin or lightweight annotators

Marginalia activates rich annotators by default. Depending on your preference
you may want to use the builtin annotators or even no annotators by default and
only activate the annotators on demand by invoking ~marginalia-cycle~.

In order to disable an annotator permanently, the ~marginalia-annotators~ can be
modified. For example if you prefer to never see file annotations, you can
delete all file annotators from the registry.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq marginalia-annotators
        (assq-delete-all 'file marginalia-annotators))
#+end_src

To use the builtin annotators by default, you can run the following code.
Replace =builtin= by =none= to disable annotators by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapc (lambda (x)
        (setcdr x (cons 'builtin (remq 'builtin (cdr x)))))
      marginalia-annotators)
#+end_src

As an alternative to ~marginalia-cycle~, if a completion category supports two
annotators, you can toggle between them using the following command.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun marginalia-toggle ()
    (interactive)
    (mapc
     (lambda (x)
       (setcdr x (append (reverse (remq 'none
                                        (remq 'builtin (cdr x))))
                         '(builtin none))))
     marginalia-annotators))
#+end_src

After cycling the annotators you may want to automatically save the
configuration. This can be achieved using an advice which calls
~customize-save-variable~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (advice-add #'marginalia-cycle :after
              (lambda ()
                (let ((inhibit-message t))
                  (customize-save-variable 'marginalia-annotators
                                           marginalia-annotators))))
#+end_src

* Icons in the minibuffer

Marginalia focuses on text annotations. The [[https://github.com/rainstormstudio/nerd-icons-completion][nerd-icons-completion]] package is
compatible with Marginalia and uses the special NerdFonts to add icons in front
of minibuffer completion candidates. There exist related packages to enhance
Dired, Ibuffer, Corfu and other modes with icons consistently.
